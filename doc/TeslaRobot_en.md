# Prediction: Musk will next develop unmanned aircraft and unmanned ships to construct an all-knowing "Musk" Transformer with sea, land, air and sky functions

2023.03.01, at Tesla’s Investor Day, Musk has likened his self-driving Tesla cars to “robots on wheels.”

I guess Musk is developing my "github-style robotic (Transformer) theory 
based on the warehouse/workshop model", 
so let me put the products of the companies under Musk's control together 
in accordance with my theory, and you should see it.

It is well known that Tesla cars are connected to the AI system of Tesla Inc. 
and each Tesla car can be seen as a cell (bilocation or component) of this AI system, 
which is, as my theory describes, 
"with factories (companies, space fortresses, etc.) as robots and transformers, 
then the robots and transformers have the metabolic capacity to develop themselves 
and maintain themselves." Let's take this model as the core and integrate 
the products of the companies under Musk's control according to my theory 
to construct the all-knowing "Musk" Transformers with sea, land, air and sky functions.

```

==== the all-knowing "Musk" Transformers with sea, land, air and sky functions ====

Land: Tesla Motors : Cars (armored cars, tanks) robots and Transformers

Sky : SpaceX : Starlink (Space Fortress) robots and Transformers

Air : Unmanned aircraft : Flying robots and Transformers

Sea : Unmanned Ships : Unmanned Ships and Submarines robots and Transformers

Total: Neuralink : brain-computer interface, connecting Musk's brain to AI systems

```

If you still want me to predict what Musk wants to do next, 
I guess Musk should go to Mars next to build a "Garden of Eden", 
of course, this project is long and costly, 
if Musk can not wait, he can find a mountain on Mars, 
dig a cave to live, and the mountain named "Mount Olympus".
