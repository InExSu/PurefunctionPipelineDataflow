               Clojure -> DBMS, Super Foxpro
                   STM -> Transaction，MVCC
Persistent Collections -> db, table, col
              hash-map -> indexed data
                 Watch -> trigger, log
                  Spec -> constraint
              Core API -> SQL, Built-in function
              function -> Stored Procedure
             Meta Data -> System Table

I don’t care about static or dynamic types, nor about FP, LP, or OO. For me, 
they are overly complex, unreliable, and unscientific. I think they are very bad and upset me.

The production methods and business management ideas of large industries are also more mature than FP&OO. 
I have used them as programming ideas.

I think that RMDB is the simplest and most reliable in theory and practice, 
and it is the most rigorous, long-term, high-stress test in critical situations.

Before using clojure, I was a Foxpro programmer. 
I used clojure as a super Foxpro, 
and I also used it successfully in the field of WebApp and R language mixed programming. 
I will continue to apply this routine to the AI field in the future.

The main development goal of clojure is to write the database. 
The development idea is actually from the database, not the FP.
