In Communications of the ACM, February 2019, David Patterson 
and John Hennessey co-published a paper: 
《A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture》, 
explaining their analysis and prospects 
for the development of computing architecture 
in the next ten years. The paper points out that 
a hardware-centric, domain-specific architectures (DSA) 
will provide significant performance 
and energy efficiency gains, bringing new vitality 
and development opportunities to computers 
as Moore's Law is coming to an end.

## Comment

- Just discover the advantages of DSA (Google TPU, etc.) 
  currently on the market and predict that 
  DSA will generate significant performance 
  and energy efficiency benefits, 
  But it did not specify what architecture 
  should be used to organize, coordinate, 
  and control these DSAs to complete tasks, 
  Because the DSA application field is very limited, 
  a new architecture must be designed to combine 
  general-purpose CPUs and multiple DSAs 
  to complete the task together. That is, 
  a new computer architecture is not 
  proposed to solve the problem.

- If it is an article about DSA, 
  it should cite Google TPU, 
  ASIC related literature.

- If it is to organize CPU and DSAs to complete 
  tasks with a new computer architecture, 
  then it should refer to my 
  "The Grand Unified Programming Theory: 
  The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow with 
  Principle-based Warehouse/Workshop Model".
  
## Conclusion

The two Turing Award winners did not publish 
new views or solutions in this report. 
I don’t think there is any innovation in it. 
I don’t understand that so many people 
will cite this article. 
Is it just because of celebrity effects? 

Anyone with ambition

- Don't pointlessly cite low-quality and low-relevant celebrity articles, 
  which will show that the author has no professional judgment.
  
- Don't write citations just because the author of the reference is not well-known, 
  it will show that the author's professional ethics is stained.
