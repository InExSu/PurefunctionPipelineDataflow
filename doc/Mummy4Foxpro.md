# The mummy returns 4: Foxpro programming model is the development direction of the future programming language

Copyright © 2021.11.07 Lin Pengcheng, all rights reserved.

In the past few years, my theory has continuously improved Foxpro’s TIOBE ranking 
from a long-term state of death to 21 in November 2021, ranking first in the second echelon, 
one place ahead of October 2021, and entering the first echelon next month? 
People in the language world are going to be stunned.

In fact, this is unexpected and reasonable. The Apple M1 chip shows my 
"The Grand Unified Programming Theory: The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow with Principle-based Warehouse/Workshop Model" 
unparalleled high performance and low power consumption advantages, 
other A group of chip manufacturers began to follow and invest in research.

What kind of programming language should be developed to adapt 
to this new theory and the development trend of new chips. 
The Foxpro programming model is the most suitable for my theory, 
as long as it simply supports memory tables and pipeline operators. 
The more difficult thing is the scheduling mechanism. 
This aspect can be gradually optimized. 
Then grafted onto a popular platform to be compatible with the existing development ecosystem.

I think it is time for Microsoft to consider redeveloping Foxpro 
and stage an IT version of "The mummy returns".

Foxpro is a prehistoric fossil of the Internet. It has long been dead, 
no one uses it, and no one mentions it. In recent years, 
only my theory has been repeatedly advocated. 
People may be curious to search and understand Foxpro, 
so it improves Foxpro's ranking. In addition, 
it seems that there is no outstanding application case or theory to improve Foxpro's ranking.

# 木乃伊归来4: Foxpro编程模型是未来编程语言的发展方向

这几年, 我的理论把Foxpro的TIOBE排名从长期死亡状态持续提高到11月份的21名, 第二梯队头名, 
比10月份前进一位, 下个月进入第一梯队(1-20名)?一众编程语言界的人要目瞪狗呆了.

其实这是意料之外, 情理之中的事. 苹果M1芯片展示了我的
"大统一编程理论: 纯函数管道数据流和基于仓库/车间模型"
无以伦比的高性能低功耗优势, 其他一众芯片厂商开始追随投入研究.

编程语言应该发展成什么模样才能适应这种新理论和新芯片的发展潮流. Foxpro编程模型最适合我的理论了, 
只要简单地支持内存表, 管道操作符就行了, 困难一点的是调度机制, 这方面可以慢慢优化. 
然后嫁接到一个流行的平台上以兼容利用现有的开发生态就可以了.

我想微软是时侯考虑重新开发Foxpro, 上演一场IT版的《木乃伊归来》.

Foxpro是互联网史前化石, 早就死透了, 没人用, 也没人提及了, 
近几年就只有我的理论一再鼓吹, 人们可能因为好奇去搜索和了解Foxpro, 
因此提高了Foxpro的排名.
除此之外, 好象没有什么出色的应用案例或理论来提高Foxpro的排名了.
