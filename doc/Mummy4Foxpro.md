# Foxpro Database-oriented programming paradigm is the development direction of the future programming language

Copyright © 2021.11.07 Lin Pengcheng, all rights reserved.

In the past few years, my theory has continuously improved Foxpro’s TIOBE ranking 
from a long-term state of death to 21 in November 2021, ranking first in the second echelon, 
one place ahead of October 2021, and entering the first echelon next month? 

People in the language world are going to be stunned.
It is surprising, but it is in line with future development trends.

The Apple M1 chip shows my 
[`The Grand Unified Programming Theory: The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow with Principle-based Warehouse/Workshop Model`](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow) 
unparalleled high performance and low power consumption advantages, 
other A group of chip manufacturers began to follow and invest in research.

This development trend necessitates the improvement of the computing algorithm:

- If a factory (computer system) has only one workshop (CPU), then it is more efficient 
  for the workshop (CPU) to manage the raw materials (data) by itself.

- If a factory (computer system) has many and different types of workshops (CPU, GPU, ASICs), 
  then it is easier and more efficient to manage raw materials (data) 
  by a dedicated management department (warehouse, database). 
  The method can perform heterogeneous parallel computing more simply, 
  more convenient for the scheduler to perform global optimization, 
  more efficient data exchange, and improve overall resource efficiency. 
  The benefits outweigh the cost of data management.

What kind of programming language should be developed to adapt 
to the development trend of this new programming theory and new computer architecture?

- The Foxpro programming model is the most suitable for my theory, 
  as long as it simply supports memory tables and pipeline operators. 
  The more difficult thing is the scheduling mechanism. 
  This aspect can be gradually optimized. 
  Then grafted onto a popular platform to be compatible with the existing development ecosystem.
  I think it is time for Microsoft to consider redeveloping Foxpro 
  and stage an IT version of "The mummy returns".
  
- Clojure only needs to integrate H2 (or SQLite), JDBC, and SQL into the core of the language, 
  and let all core APIs natively support H2 (or SQLite) and JDBC, 
  and then gradually improve the scheduling mechanism.  

Foxpro is a prehistoric fossil of the Internet. It has long been dead, 
no one uses it, and no one mentions it. In recent years, 
only my theory has been repeatedly advocated. 
People may be curious to search and understand Foxpro, 
so it improves Foxpro's ranking. In addition, 
it seems that there is no outstanding application case or theory to improve Foxpro's ranking.

# Foxpro面向数据库的编程范式是未来编程语言的发展方向

这几年, 我的理论把Foxpro的TIOBE排名从长期死亡状态持续提高到11月份的21名, 第二梯队头名, 
比10月份前进一位, 下个月进入第一梯队(1-20名)?一众编程语言界的人要目瞪狗呆了.

其实这是意料之外, 情理之中的事. 苹果M1芯片展示了我的
[`大统一编程理论: 纯函数管道数据流和基于仓库/车间模型`](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow) 
无以伦比的高性能低功耗优势, 其他一众芯片厂商开始追随投入研究.

这种发展趋势, 需要对计算的算法进行改进:

- 如果一个工厂(计算机系统)只有一个车间(CPU), 那么, 由车间(CPU)自行管理原料(数据)更高效.

- 如果一个工厂(计算机系统)有非常多个且不同种类的车间(CPU,GPU, ASICs), 
  那么,由一个专门的管理部门(仓库, 数据库)管理原料(数据)更为简单和高效,
  这种方法可以更简单地进行异构并行计算, 更方便调度器进行全局优化, 
  更高效地进行数据交换, 提高总体资源效率, 获得的效益超过了所增加的数据管理成本.

编程语言应该发展成什么模样才能适应这种新的编程理论和新的计算机架构的发展潮流?

- Foxpro编程模型最适合我的理论了, 只要简单地支持内存表, 管道操作符就行了, 
  困难一点的是调度机制, 这方面可以慢慢优化. 
  然后嫁接到一个流行的平台上以兼容利用现有的开发生态就可以了.
  我想微软是时侯考虑重新开发Foxpro, 上演一场IT版的《木乃伊归来》.
 
- Clojure只需要把H2(或SQLite), JDBC和SQL整合到语言核心, 并让所有核心API原生支持H2(或SQLite)和JDBC，
  然后逐步改进调度机制。

Foxpro是互联网史前化石, 早就死透了, 没人用, 也没人提及了, 
近几年就只有我的理论一再鼓吹, 人们可能因为好奇去搜索和了解Foxpro, 
因此提高了Foxpro的排名.
除此之外, 好象没有什么出色的应用案例或理论来提高Foxpro的排名了.
